# LifeCycleConsumption

Model Description

This app demonstrates the Life-cycle Consumption Problem, which models how an individual might optimally consume resources over their lifetime.

    a(t): Assets over time
    c(t): Optimal consumption over time
    œÅ (rho): Consumption rate
    r: Interest rate (Interest income rate)
    T: Time horizon

Adjust the parameters in the sidebar to see how they affect the optimal consumption and asset paths.
